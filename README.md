Finch.gae
=========

Something like a port of [chatgris/finch](https://github.com/chatgris/finch)
that runs on Google App Engine. The goal was to learn how to code and deploy a
golang app on GAE.

```sh
$ export PATH=$HOME/vendor/google_appengine:$PATH
$ dev_appserver.py .
$ firefox http://localhost:8080/
```
